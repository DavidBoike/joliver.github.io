            <p>In SOA, events facilitate loose coupling. One of the primary tenets of SOA is that services define schema and contract not class or type. For this reason it is good to keep the event definitions separate from your code. In fact, Udi recommend keeping this separation to the utmost—by having totally separate source control repositories for the event definitions and another for the service implementation.
One issue that we've experienced in strongly typed, compile-time friendly . <a class="read-more" href="https://blog.jonathanoliver.com/nservicebus-distributing-event-schemacontract/">&raquo;</a></p>

He's really great to talk to but it can sometimes be like sipping from the fire hose. This is a good thing.

            <p>A few weeks ago I blogged about implementing optimistic concurrency control using the Dynamo clone storage engines. I need to give an update to this technique that is specific to Riak.
Riak supports an "if-match" header that allows you to implement OCC out of the box. The only quirk with this technique—per my understanding—is that it is single-node based. In other words, if I have two concurrent writers that are updating a particular value and they are operating against two different nodes, the " <a class="read-more" href="https://blog.jonathanoliver.com/optimistic-concurrency-in-riak-take-2/">&raquo;</a></p>

To think that someone would take a nice scalable storage solution and put it back under the thumb of an RDBMS is nuts. But that's exactly what my previous post talks about.
If it's so crazy, why blog about it? I agree, it's pretty crazy to want to put a Dynamo instance under the thumb of an RDBMS. <a class="read-more" href="https://blog.jonathanoliver.com/somewhere-werner-is-crying/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>One of the main concerns that may be expressed in reviewing my previous blog post about idempotent messaging patterns is that of disk usage. The concern is about retaining every. single. message we ever publish. That's a lot of messages. That's a lot disk space.
Before we dig into one plausible solution, let's first look at a few mitigating factors. First, disk space is cheap. Really cheap. We're moving into the sub-$100 for 2 TBs of disk space. <a class="read-more" href="https://blog.jonathanoliver.com/message-idempotency-patterns-and-disk-usage/">&raquo;</a></p>
