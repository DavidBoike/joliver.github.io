<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> is awesome. I browse the site every day because love the continual stream of relevant stories and articles for tech-savvy people. Stories there are sorted by using an algorithm based upon time and community up-votes, among other things. This means that the first page of results is an ever-changing set of compelling and intellectually revealing articles.</p>

<p>My phone started going crazy with email alerts on Sunday afternoon. I was receiving a bunch of email alerts for new Disqus comments on my blog. An <a href="https://joliver.github.io/why-i-left-dot-net">opinion piece that I had written</a> in January 2014 was apparently relevant again. After about the fourth alert in as many minutes, I figured the article had been linked to from someone else's recent blog post. After about 10 email alerts, I decided to take a look. Sure enough, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7961948">there I was on page one of Hacker News</a>. My article peaked in the top 10 and stayed on page one for about 12 hours. Actually, I have no idea how I got there. Someone posted it and it go up-voted and things went from there. As of this moment, Monday morning, the HN thread has 106 comments and my blog has 120.</p>

<p>Almost without exception, I was highly impressed with the quality of conversation on the HN thread. While not all of the comments were favorable of my article, virtually all comments were well-reasoned and thoughtful. This speaks volumes about the quality of people on Hacker News. I imagine it's because HN attracts people who are passionate about their craft. A lot of other forums degrade into flame wars that so easily get off track the moment there's a spelink mistake or other grammatical issue instead of staying focused on the content.</p>

<h4 id="key-take-aways">Key Take-aways:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Listening and truly hearing what other people not just say, but mean is hard.</li>
<li>People have divergent viewpoints—that's okay.</li>
<li>People's life experiences may not allow them to understand your position.</li>
<li>Give respect to their views.</li>
<li>There's enough room in the technical domain for multiple solutions to a problem.</li>
<li>Divergent views can make you re-evaluate your opinion—this is a <strong>good</strong> thing.</li>
<li>Don't dig in and ignore their views—allow yourself to be influenced by others.</li>
<li>Don't take it personally—you're just another blog post to them.</li>
<li>You can't convince everyone.</li>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/386/">Allow people to be wrong on the internet</a>.</li>
<li>Word choice in a blog post (or follow-up comment) matters a great deal.</li>
<li>When writing about a solution to a problem, it may be worth discussing it from several angles to encompass a larger audience.</li>
<li>Enjoy your five minutes of fame. You never know when or if you'll see it again.</li>
</ul>

<p>My brief time on Hacker News was very informative and educational. I'm glad I was able to experience it. The people on that site are first class and their viewpoints carry weight and deserve appropriate consideration.</p>
